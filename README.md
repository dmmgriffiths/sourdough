# Sourdough

I started making sourdough April 2020 like everyone else!

My methods prioritize simplicity and minimize number of steps.

## Starter

You need a strong starter for this whole gig to work. I would recommend just getting a good one from someone else. They will be thrilled to share it with you, or just go ahead and buy one!

### Feeding

Keep in the fridge, about 100g in a large glass jar. Feed about 4 hours before you need it with the weight required in the recipe.

`50g starter = 25g flour + 25g water`

Put an elastic band at the level of the fed starter (after you've mixed it up). It's ready to use when doubled in size and bubbly. 

## Focaccia 

```
390g water
50g starter
450g white flour
50g whole wheat flour
7g salt
```

1. Mix all ingredients together. Wait 30 mins.
2. Add 30g olive oil on top, then stretch and fold. Wait ~3 hours.
3. Coat a 9x13in pan generously with butter.
4. With oiled hands, transfer the dough to the pan. Stretch it out a bit, it will fill in the rest on the next rise.
5. When risen and puffy (overnight), preheat the oven to 410F and:
- Dimple all over by pressing wet fingers all the way to the bottom.
- Pour a thin layer of olive oil over the top. The dimples should have some olive oil in, but not be full.
- Sprinkle with sea salt 
- Add fresh rosemary or sage leaves all over.
6. Cook for 35 minutes. It's best first day. Don't put in a plasic bag to store, it will lose its lovely crispy texture. 

## Sandwich Loaf

375g water
50g starter
500g white flour

# Sourdough

I started making sourdough April 2020 like everyone else!

My methods prioritize simplicity and minimize number of steps.

## Starter

You need a strong starter for this whole gig to work. I would recommend just getting a good one from someone else. They will be thrilled to share it with you, or just go ahead and buy one!

### Feeding

Keep in the fridge, about 100g in a large glass jar. Feed about 4 hours before you need it with the weight required in the recipe.

`50g starter = 25g flour + 25g water`

Put an elastic band at the level of the fed starter (after you've mixed it up). It's ready to use when doubled in size and bubbly. 

## Focaccia 

```
390g water
50g starter
450g white flour
50g whole wheat flour
7g salt
```

1. Mix all ingredients together. Wait 30 mins.
2. Add 30g olive oil on top, then stretch and fold. Wait ~3 hours.
3. Coat a 9x13in pan generously with butter.
4. With oiled hands, transfer the dough to the pan. Stretch it out a bit, it will fill in the rest on the next rise.
5. When risen and puffy (overnight), preheat the oven to 410F and:
- Dimple all over by pressing wet fingers all the way to the bottom.
- Pour a thin layer of olive oil over the top. The dimples should have some olive oil in, but not be full.
- Sprinkle with sea salt 
- Add fresh rosemary or sage leaves all over.
6. Cook for 35 minutes. It's best first day. Don't put in a plasic bag to store, it will lose its lovely crispy texture. 

## Sandwich Loaf

```
375g water
50g starter
500g white flour
7g salt
```

1. Mix all ingredients together. Wait 30 mins.
2. Stretch and fold. Wait ~3 hours.
3. Coat a 2lb loaf pan with butter.
4. Stretch and fold, then transfer the dough to the pan.
5. When risen to just below the rim (overnight), preheat the oven to 430F.
6. Put in the oven, and reduce the temperature to 380F. Cook for 50 minutes. Store in a plasic bag to keep it soft.
